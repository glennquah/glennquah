# 🌟 Glenn Quah Han Rong 🌟

## Full-Stack Developer | Innovation Explorer

Hello there! I'm Glenn, a coding aficionado, globe-trotter, and tech innovator all rolled into one. Currently soaking up the Nordic vibes in Oslo, Norway, I'm living my dream as a Full-Stack Developer at Urban Sharing, thanks to the amazing NUS Overseas Colleges program.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To:
- Developing seamless digital solutions by day (and sometimes by night) at **Urban Sharing**.
- Exploring the ins and outs of **Information Systems at the National University of Singapore**, aiming for that sweet First Class Honours.
- Sipping on coffee in Oslo's bustling cafés, always on the lookout for Skolebrød companions.

### More About Me
- **From Barista to Brainiac:** Journeyed from mastering lattes at Starbucks to engineering codes that might just change the world.
- **Team Player:** Whether it's leading a platoon or climbing with the NUS Climbing Club, I believe in the power of teamwork.
- **Innovator at Heart:** From [ConnectCard's](https://github.com/glennquah/ConnectCard) QR magic to gamifying productivity with [EARN O'CLOCK](https://github.com/glennquah/EarnOClock), I'm all about turning ideas into reality.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- The secrets of Norwegian culture and how to make the perfect Skolebrød.
- Advanced coding techniques and frameworks to keep sharpening my full-stack skills.
- The art of Nordic work-life balance – because there's more to life than code.
